# Year End Review

## 1) What did you like most about this course?

I think it was the atmosphere of the course in general. Safe place, where every comment or idea was welcomed. Interesting up to date topics,
that were presented to us with positive energy and motivational spirit.

## 2) What did you like least about this course?

Watching 30 min length video :D that was killing me.

## 3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?

- using markdown
- to storytell better
- keep the balance between formal and informal voice and tone

## 4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?

The first-ever assignment given. Giving instruction of an object to somebody else that has never seen it before. The one had to draw it just by reading my instruction.
As for designer, it is important to be able to translate thougts and visions to other people. And only by giving them clear instruction they can understand you.
That is what I have learnt during this team activity.

## 5) What’s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?

My bachalor's thesis, as it's topic was something I was very passionete about and I intended to do a good job. But also completing a big task - brand illustrations for Impact Hub.

## 6) What’s one thing you learned about yourself?

That I need to continuously work on the level of my confidence, so I can have a more stable mindset:)

## 7) What’s one thing you could have done better?

In retrospective, I can say there were things that deserved more attention and commitment. I wish that I could have been more active and be more expressive in the class as I wanted to. At the same time trying to balance the work and school life was challenging and I’ve done what I could.

## 8) What’s one thing I could have done better?

I have nothing to say. Only that I appreciate your unconventional approach and support during the whole course. Thank you for that!

## 9) What’s one thing you would add or change about this course?

The only thing I can think of is adding more in-class work so everybody gets involved and gets to sharpen their English skills. 

## 10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?

Don’t be afraid to speak. Aside from learning valuable things by doing your HW, this is the place where you can practice your English and get better at it.
