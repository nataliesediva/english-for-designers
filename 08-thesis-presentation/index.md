- - -

When choosing a topic for my bachelor's thesis, it was crucial that it is close to me and I know
something about it. I have always been fascinated by the world of film and was attracted by its
artistic value. My visit to the Locarno Film Festival became a big inspiration. I admired the
creativity across the festival architecture, promotional materials and other details.

This experience led me to the decision to approach the founder of the film and video production
company Cingeretic and develop a corporate identity proposal for his company. Cingeretik offers
a complete package of services consisting of film and video production, but also creates
educational content for filmmakers all over the world. It aims to create an international network
of filmmakers an d creatives and wants to operate fully online. The goal of my work is to create
an optimal corporate identity that will clearly communicate the corporate values of Cingertetik.

## Film Industry Definition

At the beggining, it was important for me to understand what is the film industry made of.
Thanks to the conversations I had with client and to the research I did, I gained valuable facts.
It is all about collaboration between different departements of the film industry in order to
create a movie. T his sector provides many professional opportunities and can also have an
economic impact on tourism.

## Analyses of visual styles

I focused on researching companies that have many elements in common with Cingertetik. For a
more detailed analysis, I have sele cted the ones that contribute to the development and support
of the film and creative industry.

I was mainly interested in their work with visual identity and the way they communicate with
their supporters and surroundings. In more detail, activities in th e online world, on websites and
social networks. A24, Filmmakers Academy, Midpoint Institute, Superside, Locarno.

## Visual Style

The visual style for Cingertetik is based on the knowledge I determined earlier. It is designed in
such a way that it can communicate the essence of the company and speak to the surroundings
with its dynamism and cinematic elements. I chose the geometric shape of a triangle to represent the
style. A triangle is a specific shape that evokes imagination, otherness and creativity just by its appearance.
I take advantage of the fact that the triangle is three sided and at the end of each edge I place one department of the
company, which together form Cingertetik.

## Logo

logo consists of the Cingertetik symbol and logotype. The logo represents the film
community with its playful yet minimalist look. I achieved this by choosing a sans serif font
and choosing a contrasting color of black and white.

The symbol is composed of five triangles in the shape of the letter C. This shape is defined by
the appearance of the camera lens, where the triangles symbolize the apertures. Collectiveness
and cooperation is another element of the symbol, each triangle is a unique part of the whole
Cinergetik.

## Animations

Motion and effects are important to the cinematic world, so I decided to create an animation for
each logo variant. Animations will add originality and a technological atmosphere to the logo.
Animations symbolize the process of creation and collaboration.
Animations for the platform start with small triangles that gradually merge into a Cingergetics
symbol called Platform.
The animations for the corporate agency start
with a light blue triangle, which is gradually
complemented by darker triangles until a gradient symbol called Agency is created.
Animations for film production start with a triangle with a hidden part of the running video,
which is gradually combined with other parts until a complete symbol called Cingertetik
Films is created.
