When choosing a topic for my bachelor's thesis, it was crucial that it is close to me and I know
something about it. I have always been fascinated by the world of film and was attracted by its
artistic value. My visit to the Locarno Film Festival became a big inspiration. I admired the
creativity across the festival architecture, promotional materials and other details.

This experience led me to the decision to approach the founder of the film and video production
company Cingeretic and develop a corporate identity proposal for his company. Cingeretik offers
a complete package of services consisting of film and video production, but also creates
educational content for filmmakers all over the world. It aims to create an international network
of filmmakers an d creatives and wants to operate fully online. The goal of my work is to create
an optimal corporate identity that will clearly communicate the corporate values of Cingertetik.

## Film Industry Definition

At the beggining, it was important for me to understand what is the film industry made of.
Thanks to the conversations I had with client and to the research I did, I gained valuable facts.
It is all about collaboration between different departements of the film industry in order to
create a movie. This sector provides many professional opportunities and can also have an
economic impact on tourism.

## About Cinergetik

Cinergetik describes itself as a film and media company that uses digital technology to innovate
the way filmmakers tell stories. Through the Collective Storytelling concept, the company
focuses on developing tools and methods for effective collaboration b etween creative talents
from around the world. Believing that there are meaningful stories within each of us that need
to be told, they will focus on spreading the knowledge and access to resources that filmmakers
need to perfect their craft and produce qu ality films.

In my next steps of building visual style I have analysed the strenghts, weaknesses, oppurtunities and threats of the company.
Then created the moodboard to help me with defining target and threats of the company. Then created the moodboard to help me with defining target groups.groups.

## Visual Style

The visual style for Cingertetik is based on the knowledge I determined earlier. It is designed in
such a way that it can communicate the essence of the company and speak to the surroundings
with its dynamism and cinematic elements. I chose the geometric shape of a triangle to represent the
style. A triangle is a specific shape that evokes imagination, otherness and creativity just by its appearance.
I take advantage of the fact that the triangle is three sided and at the end of each edge I place one department of the
company, which together form Cingertetik.

## Logo

Logo consists of the Cingertetik symbol and logotype. The logo represents the film
community with its playful yet minimalist look. I achieved this by choosing a sans serif font
and choosing a contrasting color of black and white.

The symbol is composed of five triangles in the shape of the letter C. This shape is defined by
the appearance of the camera lens, where the triangles symbolize the apertures. Collectiveness
and cooperation is another element of the symbol, each triangle is a unique part of the whole
Cinergetik.
