# FINDING YOUR STYLE
- - -

So I was wondering what is it that I would like to speak about and make an presentation about. And during our mindmap excerscise I find out that it has to do something with finding my style, finding motivation or inspiration. Having these topics written on the paper it led me to think of list of activities, where I am dealing with these topics. And one of them were illustrations. In order to that I will demostrate this presentatioon on Illustrations!

So I donâ€™t know how many of you also have the experience, but when applying to job posts I got many questions like and what is your art style?
I was like wait, but I do not have one. What should I do now? I need to find my style!

***Let's say it at the beggining,*** you do not find your own art style you develop it, after years of practice.

 It is similar to when your music taste developes or you find your favorite drink or movie - it is a discovery process that continues to evolve through your life.
