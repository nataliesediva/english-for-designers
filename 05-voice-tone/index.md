## VOICE
When communicating with clients, my voice is:
- Humble
- Friendly
- Honest

<br>

## TONE
When communicating with clients, my tone is:
- Straightforward
- Kind
- Openminded

<br>

## STYLE
What I do when communicating with clients:
- I divide text into shorter paragraphs to make my communication easy to read. Also easy for them to navigate their replies to.
- I use "!" or ":)" at the end of a sentence that I want to highlight or give an emphasise into
- My communication in texts is similar to a conversation. I always try to find the tone that will fit the communication the best and try to be appropriate with my style   in the text.
